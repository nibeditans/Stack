Stack Operations
This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates basic stack operations. It allows users to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, peek at the topmost element of the stack, and display the contents of the stack.

Instructions
* Run the Stack_in_Python.py file using a Python interpreter.
* Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various stack operations.
* Choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number:
      1: Push an element onto the stack.
      2: Pop an element from the stack.
      3: Peek at the topmost element of the stack.
      4: Display the contents of the stack.
      5 or any other input: Exit the program.
* Depending on your choice, provide additional inputs as requested.
* The program will execute the selected operation and display the results.




Repository Contents
* stack_operations.py: The Python program that implements stack operations.
* README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the program.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different stack operations!
